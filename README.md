# GD50-Projects
Projects made for free online game development class GD50

All of the projects seen here were completely coded by myself with direction from the course. 2/3rds of the course was taught with LOVE2D using Lua, but the last couple of projects used Unity and C#. To run the Lua games, you must install LOVE2D and run them as LOVE2D instructs. With the Unity games, there should be an executable file that you can run to play the games (if there isn't let me know, and I can quickly create one!).
